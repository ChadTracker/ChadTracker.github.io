// This file will serve to explain how to upload pictures and display them.

I've already defined the CSS rules so styling will not be an issue. 

All you need to do is upload the picture to github in this joint.

After that use the following HTML code to add the picture to the website.

<img src="name_of_picture_file" class="pictures">

Replace the src with the name of the picture you uploaded to the Github. Don't say "name_of... etc.

Once done with the HTML code addition, hit the green committ changes button at the bottom of the page.

The website will need a minute or two to update but the URL will remain the same.


//Note the HTML code goes in the index.html file on a seprate line all by its self.


// DO NOT MESS WITH ANYTHING IN THE CSS OR JAVASCRIPT FILES!!!

// DO NOT DELETE ANYTHING UNLESS TOLD TO DO SO!!!

// Contact me for any problems or questions...

//Depending on the height or width of the picture, the picture may become squished. Don't worry about it.
The CSS rules I made are a "catch-all" if you will. 

//For the pictures to display better, take them horizontally.
